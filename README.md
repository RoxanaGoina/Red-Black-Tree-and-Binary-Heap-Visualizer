# Red-Black-Tree-and-Binary-Heap-Visualizer



The project is an application that allows visualization of two very important data structures in programming: red-black trees and binary heaps. This application can be used by those who study data structures for better understanding and by those who use these structures.

Regarding the implementation, the programming language used is C++, without presenting a graphic interface.

Regarding the binary heap menu, users can add nodes and view the binary heap in the form of min-heap or max-heap.
Regarding the menu for red-black trees, the user is allowed to add, delete nodes and, of course, view the red-black tree
